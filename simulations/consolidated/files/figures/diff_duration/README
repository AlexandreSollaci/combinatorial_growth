The figures here are each created assuming that the subsidy lasts for as long as the second part of the simulation. Ex: the 5 years folder has the simulation for a subsidy that runs for 5 years and after we compute the welfare gains; the 25 years folder does the same, but we run the subsidy for 25 years and compute welfare only 25 after the baseline simulation is over.
